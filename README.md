# Matrix Operations Practice (Java)

This project contains simple exercises related to 2D arrays (matrices) in Java.  
It includes basic matrix operations such as:

- Filling a matrix with user input
- Printing a matrix
- Transposing a matrix
- Adding two matrices
- Finding the smallest value in each row
- Finding the largest value in each column

> **Note:** This is not a complete application, but a set of exercises for practicing fundamental matrix operations.

## 📁 Files
- `MatrixApp.java`: Contains helper methods for matrix operations.
- `Main.java`: Runs basic input, sum, and transpose functions.
- `RowColumnMinMax.java`: Allows users to find row minimums or column maximums from a preset matrix.

## 🛠 Technologies
- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code (any Java-compatible IDE)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the `.java` files.
3. Run `Main.java` or `RowColumnMinMax.java` as needed.
